## Setup & Configuration<a id="setup--configuration"></a>

### Supported Language Versions<a id="supported-language-versions"></a>

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.7`

### Installation<a id="installation"></a>

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install edugram-sdk
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout<a id="setting-a-custom-timeout"></a>

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```py
from edugram import Edugram

sdk = Edugram(timeout=10000)
```

# Sample Usage<a id="sample-usage"></a>

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```py
from edugram import Edugram

sdk = Edugram(
    timeout=10000
)

result = sdk.index.root_get()

print(result)

```

# Async Usage<a id="async-usage"></a>

The SDK includes an Async Client for making asynchronous API requests. This is useful for applications that need non-blocking operations, like web servers or apps with a graphical user interface.

```py
import asyncio
from edugram import EdugramAsync

sdk = EdugramAsync(
    timeout=10000
)


async def main():
  result = await sdk.index.root_get()
  print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```
